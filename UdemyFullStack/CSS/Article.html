        <h1>Information Security</h1>

<p>
    Information Security is not only about securing information from unauthorized access. Information Security is basically the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. Information can be physical or electronic one. Information can be anything like Your details or we can say your profile on social media, your data in mobile phone, your biometrics etc. Thus Information Security spans so many research areas like Cryptography, Mobile Computing, Cyber Forensics, Online Social Media etc.

    During First World War, Multi-tier Classification System was developed keeping in mind sensitivity of information. With the beginning of Second World War formal alignment of Classification System was done. Alan Turing was the one who successfully decrypted Enigma Machine which was used by Germans to encrypt warfare data. 

    Information Security programs are build around 3 objectives, commonly known as CIA – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. 
     
</p>

<p>
    Confidentiality – means information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities and process. For example if we say I have a password for my Gmail account but someone saw while I was doing a login into Gmail account. In that case my password has been compromised and Confidentiality has been breached.
    Integrity – means maintaining accuracy and completeness of data. This means data cannot be edited in an unauthorized way. For example if an employee leaves an organisation then in that case data for that employee in all departments like accounts, should be updated to reflect status to JOB LEFT so that data is complete and accurate and in addition to this only authorized person should be allowed to edit employee data.

    Integrity – means maintaining accuracy and completeness of data. This means data cannot be edited in an unauthorized way. For example if an employee leaves an organisation then in that case data for that employee in all departments like accounts, should be updated to reflect status to JOB LEFT so that data is complete and accurate and in addition to this only authorized person should be allowed to edit employee data.
    Availability – means information must be available when needed. For example if one needs to access information of a particular employee to check whether employee has outstanded the number of leaves, in that case it requires collaboration from different organizational teams like network operations, development operations, incident response and policy/change management. 
    Denial of service attack is one of the factor that can hamper the availability of information.

</p>


<p>
    Non repudiation – means one party cannot deny receiving a message or a transaction nor can the other party deny sending a message or a transaction. For example in cryptography it is sufficient to show that message matches the digital signature signed with sender’s private key and that sender could have a sent a message and nobody else could have altered it in transit. Data Integrity and Authenticity are pre-requisites for Non repudiation. 
 
    Authenticity – means verifying that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at destination is from a trusted source.This principle if followed guarantees the valid and genuine message received from a trusted source through a valid transmission. For example if take above example sender sends the message along with digital signature which was generated using the hash value of message and private key. Now at the receiver side this digital signature is decrypted using the public key generating a hash value and message is again hashed to generate the hash value. If the 2 value matches then it is known as valid transmission with the authentic or we say genuine message received at the recipient side

    At the core of Information Security is Information Assurance, which means the act of maintaining CIA of information, ensuring that information is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise. These issues are not limited to natural disasters, computer/server malfunctions etc. 

    Thus, the field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent years. It offers many areas for specialization, including securing networks and allied infrastructure, securing applications and databases, security testing, information systems auditing, business continuity planning etc.

<h1>Database Management System</h1>

    <article>

        <p>
            A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data.

            Database management systems are set up on specific data handling concepts, as the practice of administrating a database evolves. The earliest databases only handled individual single pieces of specially formatted data. Today’s more evolved systems can handle different kinds of less formatted data and tie them together in more elaborate ways.

        </p>


        <p>

            Over time, the models for database management systems have changed considerably. This is a key part of understanding how various DBMS options work.

            The earliest types of database management systems consisted mainly of hierarchy and network models.
            
            The hierarchy model is one where each node or component has a child/parent relationship with one other node or component.
            In the network model, the difference is that a single component can have multiple relationships – think of this as a single node being able to “multicast” connections.
        </p>


        <p>

            However, over time, these models became overtaken by something called a relational database. In the relational database model, individual components have attributes that are linked to their identities through a database table design. The rows and columns of an individual database table include those identities and attributes in such a way that traditional structured query language or SQL can be used to pull various kinds of information on these relational models.

            Since then, an even newer concept has emerged called NoSQL. Experts suggest that the best way to understand NoSQL is to translate it to mean “not only SQL,” or in other words, using NoSQL broadly to describe systems that are beyond the traditional SQL and relational database models.

        </p>
        <p>

            
            Other types of DBMS models include a graph database model, where graph models are used for semantic queries, and an entity-relational model. These offer further alternatives to traditional relational database design.
            
            Some of the newest types of DBMS can be used where a data center may have a wide disparity of differently formatted or relatively unformatted or “raw” data to work with, where records are not normalized in the conventional way. This and other types of advances have made the world of the DBMS more complex, and have heightened the value of seasoned DB engineers and administrators for modern systems.

        </p>
       
            
        <p>

            It's also important to note that NoSQL is a much more abstract term than the traditional "relational database." In a sense, NoSQL is “not relational,” at least in the traditional sense. One prominent type of NoSQL DBMS is called the object-oriented database model. Here, instead of being composed of relational tables, database systems use object designs to work with the identities and attributes discussed above.

            Some of the considerations for NoSQL database design involve the degree of normalization or structuring of data that occurs, and how the database system handles that. Engineers also have to look at tools for consistency and resolution of data throughout the system, to promote uniformity and fix various problems of correlation.
        </p>
  
        
        <p>

            The DBMS manages the data; the database engine allows data to be accessed, locked and modified; and the database schema defines the database's logical structure. These three foundational elements help provide concurrency, security, data integrity and uniform data administration procedures. Typical database administration tasks the DBMS supports include change management, performance monitoring and tuning, security, and backup and recovery. Most database management systems are also responsible for automated rollbacks and restarts as well as logging and auditing of activity in databases and the applications that access them.
