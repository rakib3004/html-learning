    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>

        Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and
           like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it. Cloud Computing tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Cloud Computing. Our Cloud Computing tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.

           Cloud computing is a virtualization-based technology that allows us to create, configure, and customize applications via an internet connection. The cloud technology includes a development platform, hard disk, software application, and database.
           
           The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.
           
           There are the following operations that we can do using cloud computing.

    <p id="history">
        During the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via RJE (Remote Job Entry);[14] this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as IBM and DEC. Full-time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the "data center" model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM's mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.

        In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively.They began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure.As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing. They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency for end users.
        
        The use of the cloud metaphor for virtualized services dates at least to General Magic in 1994, where it was used to describe the universe of "places" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could go. As described by Andy Hertzfeld:
